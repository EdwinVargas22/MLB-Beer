## Introduction
The goal for this analysis is to find the 5 most expensive baseball teams to buy beer from and the 5 least expensive in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018. I used the beer price column, but I also used the beer price per ounce. The reason both of these were used because one team could have a high beer price, but their beer price per ounce could be low. 


### Connection and Cleaning
The first thing I had to do was to connect to my Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Once I had a successful connection, I selected the table I needed so I could view it in my jupyter notebook. I viewed the data types of the data set and changed it to the correct data types. There were 5 rows removed from the data set because it contained information that was not going to be used in this analysis. Once I finished cleaning the data set and set it up how I wanted it to be, I filtered the data set by the years and made copies of it. I ended up with 5 data sets which each contain only information from a specific year.
