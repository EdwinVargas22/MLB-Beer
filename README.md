## Introduction
The goal for this analysis is to find the 5 most expensive baseball teams to buy beer from and the 5 least expensive in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018. I used the beer price column, but I also used the beer price per ounce. The reason both of these were used because one team could have a high beer price, but their beer price per ounce could be low.
